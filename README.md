I'm Jonathan Elsner, my pronouns are he/him, and I'm currently studying at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I'm passionate about using data to understand the world around us, and the use of computers to process that information. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing board games with my friends, and listening to and playing Jazz.

*Go dawgs!*
